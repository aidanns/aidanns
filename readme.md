# [Aidan Nagorcka-Smith's Personal Site](http://www.aidanns.com)

This repo holds the personal website of Aidan Nagorcka-Smith.

The site is built using the HTML5 Boilerplate template, Twitter Bootstrap CSS library and Rack for application hosting. The live version is deployed to Heroku.

I hope you find it useful if you're trying to set up a homepage for yourself. If you have any suggestions for things to improve about the site, please email me at aidanns@gmail.com and I will be eternally thankful.
